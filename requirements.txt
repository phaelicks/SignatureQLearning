# This file subsumes the file `abides/requirements.txt`, except
# for the requirement `ray[rllib]==1.7.0` since this installs loads
# of dependencies that are not needed for this project (SignatureQLearning).

# If you want to make use of functionalities in ABIDES that require 
# `ray[rllib]`, uncomment the requirement below.

# For packages contained in both 'requirements.txt' and 'abides/requirements.txt'
# the versions originally specified in the latter are used

# requires python 3.8 which comes with pip version 19.2.3
# if upgraded to current version 23.0.1 installation of this requirements.txt 
# file gives warning for package `future` which is a dependency of `signatory`
# since it uses legacy `setup.py install` method. Currently this warning is no problem
